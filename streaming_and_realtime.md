## Realtime systems

They react **immediatelly as the events happen**.  
For example a pacemaker must react realtime as a heart ticks, or else you'd die.  
Other examples are video calls, online stocks etc.

## Streaming systems

These systems are consumers of events data.  
Similar to realtime systems in regards to **reacting to events**,
but these could be seconds or even days away from when that event happened.  
We could've stored the tweets in a db, and only when a client requests them we send it to them.
