### spring boot security
When you add "spring-boot-starter-security" BASIC-AUTH is **automatically turned on**.  
Password is printed in console when you run the app, and username is "user":
```
> Using default security password: 638fda94-f9b9-4de8-9186-a98a2187750e
```
You can set it in proerties manually:
```
security.user.password=my_password
```

### AntMatchers ordering
The `antMatchers` ordering matters!  
SPECIFIC routes should go first, like it goes through `List<Regex>` and finds first match.

### Login programatically

### @Preauthorize vs antMatchers
Cannot do `.antMatchers("/**").authenticated()` and then `@PreAuthorize("permitAll()")` on a controller method... :D  
If HTTP gets blocked, you can't "fix that" on method level..
